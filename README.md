## Overview

Web application that searches for users in the GitHub API by username and displays their information.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned how to implement switching between light and dark theme. How to use useEffect to consume from an API once the component has been rendered.


### Continued development

I would like to focus on using context rather than passing props between components. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/22388) - This helped me for because I had a warning that said: extra attributes from the server.
